- Crossref system
  - Adopt pandoc-crossref if custom labels PR is merged
  - Implement our own w/ largely similar syntax but thereom's, etc.
    Lua vs. Typescript
  figures for html/js blobs:
- display_data with type text/html
- display_data with type widget+view+json


# Package/extension system

Port a dozen or rticles formats
# markdown for bootstrap concepts/constructs
# standalone document formats
bs4-notebook
bs4-article

Project system:
  - See MkDocs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Lp39BolpTR0NzbQQ6ebr9bawYth8EeivBo0q4qapVY/edit#heading=h.ibf8kici39py
  - Terminate at _quarto.yml w/ project: true
    (need to first determine if there is a project somewhere in the parent tree,
     if there is, then use this behavior, if not, use the first match)
  - External interactions with projects (output_dir, clean, etc.)

# static site generator (project system)
bs4-website
bs4-book

bs4-dashboard

memo/proposal on computations:
will be able to use RStudio chunk output and/or notebook for compute?
or perhaps require html_notebook?
computations could even be at a URL!!!

  {{= print("x") }} 

  {{< figure projections.xlsx#chunk-label caption="asfdasdf" label="" >}}

  {{< table projections.xlsx#fy-2019 label="projections" >}}

Why did Beamer fail to render w/ missing caption package w/ our pipeline but work for pandoc pdflatex?

Port tinytex to JS; OR we need to implmeent various auto-install behaviors for latexmk, eg.
  had to do this to get biblatex working w/ latexmk
  (may want to automate installation if no biber + auto-map TinyTeX to path)
    tlmgr install biblatex
    tlmgr install biber
    ln -sf /Users/jjallaire/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/biber /usr/local/bin/biber
Note need to implement tinytex: false and tinytex options (e.g. min-runs, clean, output-dir, etc.)

More robust Julia backend

Extracate the cache dir logic from rmarkdown::render and call that

Merge -M and --metadata-file with _quarto.yml and in-file YAML with same
semantics as Pandoc

discover index.Rmd or ui.Rmd for quarto run. can't rely on
rmarkdown::run b/c we need to figure out which Rmd to render

Meta-concepts on top of AST: e.g. tabs
