- Consider purging sandbox history from repo and creating new
  quarto-sandbox repo
  https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/


- Filter:

    - kable, kableExtra, hutable, flextable
    - paged_table
    - gt

    - Lua filter


    - Many ways to generate HTML tables, we need to reach into HTML tables
      for the <caption> to look for cross-referenceable tables and from
      that create a reference
    - Tables from arbitrary divs (caption at bottom of div)

    - Comparable table handling for LaTeX output
      For LaTeX tables, it appears as if label goes inside \caption
      \caption{\label{tab:test}This title describes the content of this table.}
      So we could look for the #tbl:caption at the end and substitute the label
      Some R packages e.g. modelsummary already do this automatically so would need to
      substitute: \caption{\label{tab:mytable}This title describes the content of this table. {#tbl:content}}

      \caption{\label{tab:mytable} This title describes the content of this table.}


    - Listings for Jupyter and Rmd:
       lst.label="foo" lst.cap = "foo"

    - Forwarding of fig chunk options to data attributes (and HTML/LaTeX generation)
    - figures filter should run after the crossref filter, and
      should be responsible for converting e.g. htmlwidgets
      marked as figures to <figure>





Port tinytex to JS; OR we need to implmeent various auto-install behaviors for latexmk, eg.
  had to do this to get biblatex working w/ latexmk
  (may want to automate installation if no biber + auto-map TinyTeX to path)
    tlmgr install biblatex
    tlmgr install biber
    ln -sf /Users/jjallaire/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/biber /usr/local/bin/biber
Note need to implement tinytex: false and tinytex options (e.g. min-runs, clean, output-dir, etc.)

Why did Beamer fail to render w/ missing caption package w/ our pipeline but work for pandoc pdflatex?


# Package/extension system

Port a dozen or rticles formats
# markdown for bootstrap concepts/constructs
# standalone document formats
bs4-notebook
bs4-article

Project system:
  - See MkDocs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Lp39BolpTR0NzbQQ6ebr9bawYth8EeivBo0q4qapVY/edit#heading=h.ibf8kici39py
  - Terminate at _quarto.yml w/ project: true
    (need to first determine if there is a project somewhere in the parent tree,
     if there is, then use this behavior, if not, use the first match)
  - External interactions with projects (output_dir, clean, etc.)

# static site generator (project system)
https://victoria.dev/blog/hugo-vs-jekyll-an-epic-battle-of-static-site-generator-themes/
bs4-website
bs4-book

bs4-dashboard
bs4-presentation

memo/proposal on computations:
will be able to use RStudio chunk output and/or notebook for compute?
or perhaps require html_notebook?
computations could even be at a URL!!!

  {{= print("x") }}

  {{< figure projections.xlsx#chunk-label caption="asfdasdf" label="myplot" >}}

  {{< table projections.xlsx#fy-2019 label="projections" label="">}}

  {{< text notebook.Rmd##chunk-label >}}

More robust Julia backend

Extracate the cache dir logic from rmarkdown::render and call that

Merge -M and --metadata-file with _quarto.yml and in-file YAML with same
semantics as Pandoc

discover index.Rmd or ui.Rmd for quarto run. can't rely on
rmarkdown::run b/c we need to figure out which Rmd to render

Meta-concepts on top of AST: e.g. tabs
