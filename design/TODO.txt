- experiment with pandoc-crossref:
    - ability to reference arbitrary divs as figure, table, etc.
    - ability to do equivalent of bookdown theroems

  - !file directive

  - implement knitr (allow dashes)
  - implement r-options

fill out all the pandoc formats

implmeent tinytex: output_dir, etc. tinytex: false

memo/proposal on computations:
will be able to use RStudio chunk output and/or notebook for compute?
or perhaps require html_notebook?
omputations could even be at a URL!!!

  {{= notebook.ipynb#visualization =}}
  {{< computation notebook.Rmd#chunk-label >}}

  
  {{< figure projections.xlsx#chunk-label caption="asfdasdf" label="" >}}

  {{< table projections.xlsx#fy-2019 label="projections" >}}

  {{< text notebook.Rmd##chunk-label >}}

crossref (also implement crossref: false)

Port tinytex to JS; OR we need to implmeent various auto-install behaviors for latexmk, eg.
  had to do this to get biblatex working w/ latexmk
  (may want to automate installation if no biber + auto-map TinyTeX to path)
    tlmgr install biblatex
    tlmgr install biber
    ln -sf /Users/jjallaire/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/biber /usr/local/bin/biber
Note need to implement tinytex: false and tinytex options (e.g. min-runs, clean, output-dir, etc.)

Merge -M and --metadata-file with _quarto.yml and in-file YAML with same 
semantics as Pandoc

discover index.Rmd or ui.Rmd for quarto run. can't rely on 
rmarkdown::run b/c we need to figure out which Rmd to render

consider pluto notebooks (julia)
