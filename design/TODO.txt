- fill out all the pandoc formats

-t context, -t html, or -t ms w/ output file pdf should work

<< write tests >>


Python

memo/proposal on computations:
will be able to use RStudio chunk output and/or notebook for compute?
or perhaps require html_notebook?
omputations could even be at a URL!!!

  {{= notebook.ipynb#visualization =}}
  {{< computation notebook.Rmd#chunk-label >}}

  {{< figure projections.xlsx#chunk-label caption="asfdasdf" label="" >}}

  {{< table projections.xlsx#fy-2019 label="projections" >}}

  {{< text notebook.Rmd##chunk-label >}}

- Crossref system 
  - Adopt pandoc-crossref if custom labels PR is merged
  - Implement our own w/ largely similar syntax but thereom's, etc.
    Lua vs. Typescript

Project system:
  - Terminate at _quarto.yml w/ project: true
    (need to first determine if there is a project somewhere in the parent tree,
     if there is, then use this behavior, if not, use the first match)
  - External interactions with projects (output_dir, clean, etc.)
  
Port tinytex to JS; OR we need to implmeent various auto-install behaviors for latexmk, eg.
  had to do this to get biblatex working w/ latexmk
  (may want to automate installation if no biber + auto-map TinyTeX to path)
    tlmgr install biblatex
    tlmgr install biber
    ln -sf /Users/jjallaire/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/biber /usr/local/bin/biber
Note need to implement tinytex: false and tinytex options (e.g. min-runs, clean, output-dir, etc.)

Merge -M and --metadata-file with _quarto.yml and in-file YAML with same 
semantics as Pandoc

discover index.Rmd or ui.Rmd for quarto run. can't rely on 
rmarkdown::run b/c we need to figure out which Rmd to render







consider pluto notebooks (julia)

Meta-concepts on top of AST: e.g. tabs
